Welcome to LifeOnGrid.com
Every day we wake up with 24 hours in our hands. Now, it’s totally upto us to make them
productive. Let’s think about those 24 hours, that is, 1,440 minutes as 144 10-minute blocks.
That’s what you wake up with every day. Throughout the day, you spend 10 minutes of your life
on each block, until you eventually run out of blocks and it’s time to go to sleep. It’s always
good to step back and think about how we’re using those 144 blocks we get each day. How many
of them are put towards making your future better, and how many of them are just there to be
enjoyed? How many of them are spent with other people, and how many are for time by
yourself? How many are used to create something, and how many are used to consume
something? How many of the blocks are focused on your body, how many on your mind, and
how many on neither one in particular? Which are your favorite blocks of the day, and which are
your least favorite?
Imagine these blocks laid out on a grid. What if you had to label each one with a purpose? Now
imagine a similar grid, but one where each block is labeled exactly how you spent it yesterday.
This Web App is used to exactly do this. It can record all your daily activities and help you
analyse your day graphically. The goal is to help people use their tomorrows more productively
by constantly analysing their yesterdays.

This project is based on an article called "100 blocks a day" on WaitButWhy.
